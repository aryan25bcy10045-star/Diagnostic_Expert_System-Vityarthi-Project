# **1:- Problem Statement**

Healthcare diagnosis, especially at the preliminary stage, often relies on manual assessment of symptoms. Manual symptom assessment is frequently used in healthcare diagnosis, particularly in the early stages. Delays, human error, and challenges in early risk assessment can result from this. Many people do not have instant access to medical professionals, which can lead to poor decision-making or delayed diagnosis of potentially serious conditions.This project addresses the need for an intelligent system that can:

*Analyse symptoms reported by users. 
*Offer rule-based diagnostic recommendations.
*Use machine learning to predict risk levels.
*Offer users individualised treatment recommendations.

The objective is to provide a trustworthy, user-friendly, and effective initial diagnostic tool that combines statistical prediction with symbolic reasoning.

# **2:- Scope of the Project**

This system focuses on {early-stage symptom-based diagnosis} and {risk estimation} using hybrid AI techniques. The scope includes:

*Gathering basic symptom data from the user 
* Using a Prologue knowledge base to infer likely diagnoses
* Using a machine learning classifier to predict risk severity
* Presenting diagnosis, risk, and treatment recommendations via an intuitive graphical user interface * Offering a modular structure that can be expanded with additional symptoms, diseases, and rules

**Out of Scope:**

*Real-time clinical monitoring
*Professional medical replacement
*Integration with external medical devices
*Sophisticated multi-disease reasoning that goes beyond the rulebase

# **3:- Target Users**

The purpose of this project is to:

 Researchers and students studying machine learning, expert systems, AI, or Prologue Healthcare technology students experimenting with hybrid AI models
 People looking for a fast, initial analysis of their symptoms
 Developers seeking a model for creating more complex diagnostic systems
 It is meant to assist education and early symptom screening rather than to take the place of licensed medical advice.

# **4:- High-Level Features**

Prologue rule-based reasoning and machine learning-driven risk prediction are combined in this hybrid intelligence engine.
 Modifiable Prologue rules and symptom assertions in a dynamic knowledge base
 Using a CSV dataset for automatic machine learning training on the first run
 Tkinter-built graphical user interface for simple interaction
 Directly derived from knowledge-based inference, the diagnosis and treatment output
 Risk Prediction Model with Levels of Low, Medium, and High Severity
 Modular architecture makes it simple to add new illnesses, symptoms, or machine learning features.
